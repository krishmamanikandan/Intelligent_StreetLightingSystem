# Intelligent_StreetLightingSystem
Industry of street lighting systems are growing rapidly and going too complex with rapid growth of industry and cities. To control and maintain complex street lighting system more economically, various street light control systems are developed. Nevertheless most of developed systems have some drawbacks. So we are going to develop new light control system which can overcome old systems drawbacks. We surveyed various street light control systems and analyzed its characteristics. Through these efforts, we found that common drawbacks of most light control systems are uneasiness of handling and difficulty of maintenance. To reduce uneasiness of handling and difficulty of maintenance in operating light control system, we designed new street light control system by using Zigbee communication technique. In this thesis, we describe on the H/W design of new street light control system designed by using Zigbee communication protocol. And GIS is helpful to localizing streetlight.
 
We developed a prototype street light control system that consists of three units:
– Street Light Unit
– Gateway Unit
– Server Unit
